# Project 2 - *Wordle 2.0*

Submitted by: **Gracious Ogyiri Asare**

**Wordle 2.0** is an app that is just like the Wordle game with a little twist. You can now edit the number of guess, as well as the number of letters in the guess word. Additionally, you can choose the theme for the guess word, and even set the mode to alien, where the word changes with every wrong guess. 

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes
For my xcode, the builder takes a while so testing out the code and waiting, before finding bugs made the process tedious.
